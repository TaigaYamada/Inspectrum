-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

Hue takes the form of an angle, ranging from 0 to 360. 0 corresponds to red, 120 is for green, and blue sits at 240. Once you complete the circle and reach 360, the hue returns to pure red. Hues in-between these primary colors are represented by intermediate angles.'

However, it needs to be noted that the vibrancy of the final calculated color is also affected by the lightness. The lightest color human eyes can perceive is white. The darkest is black. Thus, at extreme values of lightness, colors with high saturation can still appear greyscale.'

Much like saturation, it spans the value of 0 to 100. 0 corresponds to complete black and 100 results in complete white. While similar, lightness in HSL is not equivalent to relative luminance in WCAG. Lightness in HSL is a mathematical calculation of the amount of light, whereas relative luminance in WCAG is supposed to represent the human perception of it.'

The exact detail of how this is done is slightly complex, but is not neccesary to use this format. The biggest advantage of hex compared to other formats is that it is short. Both RGB and HSL require 3 values to define a color, but hex only uses 1. So, this format is often employed to share a color that has already been chosen, rather than to pick a new color.',

This means that each digit has 16 possible values it can take, hence the name of the format. 2 digits of hexadecimal can represent a number between 0 to 255, matching the boundary for sRGB values. First two values correspond to red. Green and blue follows. The "#" at the start of the value has no meaning by itself, but signifies that the letters that follow them are supposed to be in the hexadecimal format. Technically, there is a shorthand syntax for hexadecimal whereby you can abbreviate the second digit if it is identical to the first. For example, #ffffff can also be written as #fff. However, for simplicity\'s sake, it is not recognized in this tool.'

        text  : 'WCAG stands for Web Content Accessibility Guideline, an international standard to ensure that digital content can be understood by everyone. Relative luminance is one of the measures introduced in that guideline, representing the human perception of brightness. Background and foreground need to have enough contrast between their relative luminances to make sure that people with different perceptions of color can also read the texts. Inspectrum automatically checks the differences between the colors and displays the result in the matrix on the right. Checkmark means the colors have sufficient contrast. Question mark means that the contrast only reaches the minimum level. Cross means that the colors fail the contrast check entirely. WCAG requres different amount of contrast for small and large text. Large text means font size above 18 points for normal weights, and above 14 points for bolder weights. This can be toggled from the top bar. For more details about the guidelines, please check the text of WCAG at https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/.'
