# Inspectrum

The grass is green. The sky is blue. Sun is yellow. These sound like a simple statement of truth. However, is all that really true?

All of us see the world with a different perception of light. Notably, those of us with color blindness can often have difficulty differentiating between hues of color.

To make sure color combinations are easily recognized by everyone, the [Web Content Accessibility Guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) defines standards of contrast.

However, the previously available tools for implementing the guidance were often limited. Some only accommodated limited formats for color input. Others were only available in a single language. Most only allowed the comparison of 2 colors at a time.

Inspectrum aims to resolve all of the above problems. It is a color contrast checker that can be used across perception, format, and language. It can calculate the contrast between multiple colors at once and display the values as a table, dramatically reducing the time and effort required to check the colors against WCAG recommendations.

The tool is available in the form of Github pages.
